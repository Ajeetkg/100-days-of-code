# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 08, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Working on the hibernate objects, foreign key/primary keys 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
